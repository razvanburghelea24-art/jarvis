"""Cora self-evaluation (Phase 4 · Section G).

Deterministic, LLM-free heuristics that read a *finished* conversation record
and propose ``improvement_candidate`` findings. The module has no authority: it
never modifies code, config, prompts, or models, never emits a rule, and never
authorizes a tool. Its output is proposal-only and is meant to be surfaced /
persisted for the owner to review, nothing else.

Inert unless the caller opts in: ``evaluate_conversation`` returns ``[]`` when
``enabled`` is False, and the intended call site is gated by the
``self_eval_enabled`` config flag (default OFF).
